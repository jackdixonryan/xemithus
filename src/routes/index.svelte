	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Welcome to Xemithus! The objective of this application is for you to establish an empire in the vastness of space. Whether you choose to work with or against other titans of industry is your decision. Step out into the void and create something for yourself.</p>

	<p>Someday, Xemithus will run on the blockchain. One of the main objectives of this application is to showcase the very probable future of smart contracts and smart payment systems. In Xemithus, you will be able to issue and fulfill contracts for other players in the space. This could be anything, from destroying a rival colony to exploring an unknown quadrant. Contracts are issued and the Xemithus Economic Authority determines internally how much they should be worth.</p>

	<p>You will be paid on your completion of those contracts, but beware: The more ZTokens the contract promises, the more dangerous it is.</p>

	<h2>The Story</h2>
	<p>In the year 2059, after the re-allotment sessions of the early 2030s, the Xemithus Prosperity Group found themselves with parsec after parsec of empty space, which the global consortium now declared a part of the new frontier. Desperation took hold, for now the Prosperity Group's dreams of a unified empire were in tatters; They had to sell the land, otherwise square parsecs of it would be taken at will from the global consortium, and for what? Galactic Park Space?</p>
	<p>After some turbulent restructuring, the XPG reformed into the Xemithus Economic Authority and came up with a simple ploy: as the central issuer of their token, they could continue to hold and control the economy of their vast territory. With this revelation, the XEA contract board was born and the XEA issued its first stock of ZTokens, which would be awarded to anyone who sought to transform the millions of parsecs into the group's dream of a shining intergalactic universe.</p>
	<p>Prosperity soars in Xemithus, and you have the opportunity to take part. Build cool shit, settle new lands, and become a member of the thriving economy.</p>
	<p>That is the story so far; the rest is up to you. The history of the galaxy will be determined by your actions. What will you choose to do?</p>

	<h2>The Tech</h2>

	<p>Xemithus's Frontend is run on <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper">Sapper from Svelte</a>, a super-cool, wicked fast web framework that cuts way down on how much energy we'll ask your computer to use. Go give them your stars. The backend is a pretty straightforward node.js API, and is where all the cool shit happens.</p>

	<p>Eventually, we'll be using some web six protocols when we go to release Xemithus Ethereum, which will use the Ethereum blockchain to process the transactions on this site. In the meantime, we'll be using plain jane Javascript to showcase the basic functionality, tracking our Ztokens and contracts through clear, transparent rails. The open economy is here!</p>
